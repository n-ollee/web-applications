      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Character ranking in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – who is the fastest, and who is the most versatile</h3>
      <p>In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, choosing a character is important for strategy and race results. Characters differ not only in appearance, but most importantly in technical parameters, which can determine success on the track. Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at the character rankings, considering their speed and versatility.</p>
      <h3>Speed ​​vs. Versatility</h3>
      <p>Although speed is a key factor in Mario Kart, many characters at the top of the list also stand out for their excellent versatility. Below, we present groups of characters that perform best on the track</p>
    </section>

    <section id="speed">
      <h2>Fastest characters:</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Bowser</h3>
        <p>Bowser is one of the characters with the highest top speed in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Thanks to his heavy weight and strong speed stat, Bowser performs best on long straight tracks, where he can take full advantage of his speed. The downside is his slower acceleration and less agile handling in tight corners — areas where lighter characters often gain the upper hand.</p>
        <p>What makes Bowser stand out is his ability to dominate opponents in close contact. His sheer mass allows him to bump lighter characters off the track or disrupt their racing line, making him intimidating in competitive play. While he requires more skill to master in tricky turns, a skilled player can make Bowser unstoppable.</p>
        <p>In addition, Bowser benefits most when paired with the right vehicle combinations — heavier karts and specific wheels amplify his natural strengths. For players who love risk–reward gameplay, Bowser delivers thrilling high-speed runs.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Wario</h3>
        <p>Wario combines high speed with heavy weight, making him a dangerous opponent, especially on straight sections. While his acceleration and maneuverability are not as strong as those of lighter characters, with the right kart and wheel setup, Wario can dominate races. He shines most on tracks with fewer turns and plenty of space to build momentum.</p>
        <p>Like Bowser, Wario’s size also helps him in direct collisions — smaller characters often lose out when racing alongside him. This makes him a bully on the track, able to control space and force opponents into mistakes.</p>
        <p>Wario also appeals to players who want a bit of style. His chaotic personality and animations add extra fun to gameplay. Choosing Wario often feels like racing with raw power wrapped in mischief, which suits players who enjoy an aggressive playstyle.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Dry bones</h3>
        <p>Although not usually associated with heavy, high-speed characters, Dry Bones surprises with his versatility. His lower weight means he lacks the physical advantage of pushing opponents aside, but his fast mini-turbo boosts and good control allow him to stay competitive against faster characters. He performs especially well on mixed tracks that require both speed and agility</p>
        <p>Dry Bones also shines in time trials or technical tracks where cornering precision is more important than brute strength. His ability to recover quickly after turns gives him an edge on maps full of curves and shortcuts.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Dry Bones’ spooky design and playful animations make him a fan favorite. While he may not look intimidating like Bowser or Wario, his adaptability often makes him a surprising and fun choice for players who value finesse over raw stats.</p>

      <h2>The most universal characters:</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Mario</h3>
        <p>Mario is the classic example of balance between all the stats in the game. He isn’t the heaviest or the absolute fastest, but his well-rounded combination of speed, acceleration, and handling makes him reliable. Mario works well on both straight and twisty tracks, which is why he’s often recommended if you don’t know what challenges to expect.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of Mario is how easily he adapts to different vehicles. Whether he’s driving a kart, a bike, or experimenting with lighter or heavier wheel choices, Mario always feels comfortable and consistent. Beginners often start with him, but even advanced players can rely on him in competitive settings.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Princess Peach</h3>
        <p>Peach focuses on agility and smooth handling. While her top speed doesn’t reach the highest values, her lighter weight and precise cornering often give her an edge over heavier opponents. She is especially strong on tracks with lots of shortcuts or obstacles where quick reactions matter.</p>
        <p>Her strength lies in her ability to accelerate back to top speed quickly after being hit or slowed down. This resilience makes her a forgiving choice for players who want stability and consistency during chaotic races with many items flying around.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Yoshi</h3>
        <p>Yoshi stands out with his excellent maneuverability and overall versatility. His stats don’t max out in any single category, but his solid speed, good acceleration, and stable handling make him a dependable choice. Yoshi performs well on a wide variety of tracks, making him perfect for players who want a character that adapts easily to different race conditions.</p>
        <p>What makes Yoshi even more appealing is his accessibility for both casual and competitive players. Beginners find him easy to control thanks to his responsive handling, while advanced players appreciate how he adapts to technical tracks.</p>

      <h2>Summary and the list of characters</h2>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
       <p>The fastest characters, such as Bowser, Wario, and Dry Bones, are all about raw speed. Heavyweights like Bowser and Wario dominate long straights with their top speed, though they sacrifice acceleration and agility. Dry Bones, on the other hand, offers a surprising balance: while not heavy, his quick mini-turbo and solid control make him competitive on mixed tracks.</p>
       <p>On the other side, the most versatile characters — Mario, Princess Peach, and Yoshi — focus on balance and adaptability. Mario is the all-rounder, reliable on nearly any track. Peach shines with agility and handling, excelling on technical tracks with tight turns or shortcuts. Yoshi combines speed and control, making him a dependable pick for players who want flexibility without weaknesses.</p>
       <p>Together, these characters highlight the trade-offs in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: speed versus control, and specialization versus balance. Choosing the right racer depends on your style — whether you prefer pure velocity or a versatile setup that adapts to any challenge.</p>
